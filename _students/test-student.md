## 🎓 Master’s Thesis Supervision

### **Master Student – Compression of CMIP6 Climate Model Outputs for AMOC Tipping Identification**
**Institution:** Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)  
**Status:** Completed / ongoing (you can update)  
**Role:** Supervisor  
**Topic:**  
Developing and evaluating data-compression strategies for **CMIP6 simulations**, with the aim of identifying early-warning signals of a potential **AMOC tipping point**. Work involves dimensionality reduction, information theory, and analysis of large ensemble climate datasets.
