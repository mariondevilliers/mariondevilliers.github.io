## Horizon Europe — AIMOC (Hybrid AI–Climate Modelling for AMOC and Impacts)

**Funding:** Horizon Europe 
**Submission:** April 2026 (Stage 1)  
**Status:** Stage 1 proposal in preparation 
**Role:** Coordinator.

Large European consortium aiming to develop hybrid frameworks combining Earth-system modelling, data assimilation, and machine learning to improve AMOC predictions.

## Novo Nordisk Foundation — AIMOC ((Hybrid AI–Climate Modelling for AMOC)

**Year:** 2025  
**Status:** Stage 1 accepted; invited to Stage 2; not selected in final round.  
**Role:** Coordinator.

Hybrid physics–ML approach to identify AMOC variability drivers and early-warning signals.

## ECMWF Special Project (ATOS) — EC-Earth4 with Regional Refinement

**Years:** 2026–2028  
**Role:** Principal Investigator (DMI, GEOMAR, Met Eireann)

High-resolution EC-Earth4 simulations using ATOS HPC:  
1. standard configuration,  
2. refined subpolar gyre,  
3. refined + Greenland freshwater forcing.

Objective: quantify how mesoscale resolution affects AMOC prediction skill.

## TIPMIP — Tipping Points Model Intercomparison Project

**Years:** 2024–2028  
**Role:** Contributor — AMOC diagnostics expert

Community model intercomparison on tipping elements of the Earth System.  
Contribution: AMOC tipping metrics, freshwater hosing experiments, and stability assessment across models.

---

## TIPMIP-OCEAN — Ocean Components of Tipping Points MIP

**Years:** 2025–2029  
**Role:** Contributor — Arctic–North Atlantic pathways and AMOC response in ECE3-ESM

Ocean-focused intercomparison investigating the sensitivity of AMOC and subpolar gyre dynamics to freshwater, heat fluxes, and stratification changes.  
Tasks include:  
- identifying AMOC early-warning fingerprints in ocean-only runs,  
- comparing ocean reanalyses and model responses,  
- participating in common experiment design.

## ObsSea4Clim — Observations & Sea State for Climate Applications

**Years:** 2023–2025  
**Role:** Task leader — ocean circulation and climate diagnostics

Integration of sea-state observations with climate models to improve upper-ocean fluxes and Arctic boundary conditions.

---

## TIpESM — Tipping Points in Earth System Models

**Years:** 2024–2027  
**Role:** Contributor — AMOC tipping detection

Evaluation of tipping dynamics in CMIP6, with an emphasis on freshwater forcing, subpolar gyre dynamics, and early-warning indicators.
