# Scientific Assessment Reports

This page summarizes my contributions as chapter leader and co-author to major scientific assessment reports.

---

## Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)   
### **Lead Author — Chapter 5: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**  
**Upcoming 2026 Climate Update Report on Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programm (2026)**

Leading Chapter 5 of the upcoming AMAP report.  
This chapter focuses on:

- Observed changes in the AMOC and model projections  
- Links between Arctic freshwater anomalies, ice melt, and AMOC stability  
- Future risks of AMOC weakening in a warming climate  
- Implications for Arctic–Atlantic climate coupling  

This third climate update report is produced under AMAP (Arctic Council) and provides updated findings on key issues previously examined in AMAP’s 2024 and 2021 Arctic Climate Change Updates, as well as earlier assessments such as SWIPA 2017 and ACIA 2005. In addition to revising earlier conclusions, the report introduces new areas of concern, including Arctic amplification, marine heatwaves, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

## JPI Climate & JPI Oceans Joint Initiative Report on AMOC  
### **Lead Author — Chapter 3: Future AMOC Weakening**

Leading Chapter 3 in the upcoming JPI Climate / JPI Oceans initiative report on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

This chapter covers:

- Projections of future AMOC strength using CMIP6 and high-resolution models  
- Assessment of climate model limitations
- Potential unstability of the AMOC
- Review of the observationnal constraints methods
- Storyline of AMOC changes
  
This report synthesizes European expertise on AMOC science for near and long term future and informs future climate strategy.

## Role of These Reports

Both assessments aim to:

- provide authoritative synthesis for policymakers,  
- highlight uncertainties and research gaps,  
- and evaluate risks related to AMOC variability and long-term weakening.

My contributions reflect my ongoing research on AMOC dynamics, freshwater forcing, and decadal variability in the subpolar North Atlantic.
