# Scientific Reports & Assessments

This page summarizes my contributions as lead author or contributing expert to major scientific assessment reports.

## Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)  
### **Lead Author — Chapter 5: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**  
**Upcoming Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Report (2026)**

I am serving as Lead Author for Chapter 5 of the upcoming AMAP assessment report.  
This chapter focuses on:

- Observed changes in the AMOC and its subpolar gyre circulation  
- Links between Arctic freshwater anomalies, ice melt, and AMOC stability  
- Future risks of AMOC weakening in a warming climate  
- Implications for Arctic–Atlantic climate coupling  

This report is produced under AMAP (Arctic Council), and will synthesize the latest scientific knowledge on ocean–cryosphere interactions.

## JPI Climate & JPI Oceans Joint Initiative Report on AMOC  
### **Lead Author — Chapter 3: Future AMOC Weakening**

I am also Lead Author of Chapter 3 in the upcoming JPI Climate / JPI Oceans initiative report on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

This chapter covers:

- Projections of future AMOC strength using CMIP6 and high-resolution models  
- Probabilistic estimates of AMOC slowdown under different emission scenarios  
- Early warning indicators and potential tipping elements  
- Societal and climate impacts of future AMOC changes  

This report synthesizes European expertise on AMOC science and informs future climate strategy.

## 📄 Role of These Reports

Both assessments aim to:

- provide authoritative synthesis for policymakers,  
- highlight uncertainties and research gaps,  
- and evaluate risks related to AMOC variability and long-term weakening.

My contributions reflect my ongoing research on AMOC dynamics, freshwater forcing, and decadal variability in the subpolar North Atlantic.

If you'd like to link specific drafts, figures, or timelines, I can add sections for them.
