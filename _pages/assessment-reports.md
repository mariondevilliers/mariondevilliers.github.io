# Scientific Reports & Assessments

This page summarizes my contributions as chapter leader and co-author to major scientific assessment reports.

---

## Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)  
### **Lead Author — Chapter 5: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**  
**Upcoming Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Report (2026)**

Leading Chapter 5 of the upcoming AMAP assessment report.  
This chapter focuses on:

- Observed changes in the AMOC and model projections  
- Links between Arctic freshwater anomalies, ice melt, and AMOC stability  
- Future risks of AMOC weakening in a warming climate  
- Implications for Arctic–Atlantic climate coupling  

This report is produced under AMAP (Arctic Council), and will synthesize the latest scientific knowledge on ocean–cryosphere interactions.

## JPI Climate & JPI Oceans Joint Initiative Report on AMOC  
### **Lead Author — Chapter 3: Future AMOC Weakening**

Leading Chapter 3 in the upcoming JPI Climate / JPI Oceans initiative report on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

This chapter covers:

- Projections of future AMOC strength using CMIP6 and high-resolution models  
- Assessment of climate model limitations
- Potential unstability of the AMOC
- Review of the observationnal constraints methods
- Storyline of AMOC changes
  
This report synthesizes European expertise on AMOC science for near and long term future and informs future climate strategy.

## Role of These Reports

Both assessments aim to:

- provide authoritative synthesis for policymakers,  
- highlight uncertainties and research gaps,  
- and evaluate risks related to AMOC variability and long-term weakening.

My contributions reflect my ongoing research on AMOC dynamics, freshwater forcing, and decadal variability in the subpolar North Atlantic.
