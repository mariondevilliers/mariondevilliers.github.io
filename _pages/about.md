I am a climate scientist specializing in the dynamics, variability, and predictability of the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)** and the **Subpolar North Atlantic**. My research combines numerical climate modelling, Arctic freshwater processes, and data-driven methods to improve our understanding of climate variability and decadal forecasting.

I currently work at the **Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)**, studying AMOC variability, Greenland freshwater fluxes, and their impact on the climate system. I collaborate widely with research teams across Europe (Ifremer, Bergen, Utrecht, CEA, ECMWF).

My work focuses on:
- AMOC dynamics and early-warning indicators  
- Greenland meltwater and ocean circulation  
- High-resolution coupled modelling (EC-Earth4, CMIP6)  
- Decadal prediction and ensemble methods  
- Machine learning to constrain climate simulations  

A full list of my publications is available in the *Publications* section.
