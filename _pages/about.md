I am a climate scientist specializing in the dynamics, variability, and predictability of the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)** and the **Subpolar North Atlantic**. My research combines numerical climate modelling, Arctic freshwater processes, and data-driven approachs to improve our understanding of climate variability and decadal forecasting.

I currently work at the **Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)**, studying AMOC variability, Greenland freshwater fluxes, and their impact on the climate system. I collaborate widely with research teams across Europe (Ifremer, NERSC, GEOMAR, CNRS, Met Éireann, IMT-Atlantique...).

My work focuses on:
- AMOC dynamics and early-warning signals 
- Greenland meltwater and ocean circulation
- Observational constraint methods applied to CMIP6 models
   
A full list of my publications is available in the *Publications* section.
